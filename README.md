## Getting Started
To get started with this repository, follow these steps:
> [!IMPORTANT]
> You need to download [QuestaSim](https://support.sw.siemens.com/en-US/) first.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```ruby
git clone https://github.com/Abdelrahman1810/Class_based_SV_Testbench_ALSU.git
```
2. Open QuestaSim and navigate to the directory where the repository is cloned.
3. Compile the Verilog files by executing the following command in the QuestaSim transcript tap: 
```ruby
do run.do
```
This will compile All files in Codes folder.


## Class-based SystemVerilog Testbench

The testbench for the ALSU design is implemented using a class-based approach in SystemVerilog. This approach provides the following benefits:

1. **Reusability**: The testbench classes can be easily reused for other design verification tasks, promoting code reuse and reducing development time.
2. **Modularity**: The testbench is organized into separate classes, each responsible for a specific task, such as stimulus generation, response checking, and coverage collection. This modular design makes the testbench easier to maintain and extend.
3. **Scalability**: The class-based approach allows the testbench to scale easily as the design complexity increases, without compromising its structure or functionality.
4. **Testability**: The class-based testbench includes built-in self-checking mechanisms and coverage collection, making it easier to assess the completeness and quality of the verification process.

By using a class-based approach, the testbench for the ALSU design ensures modularity, reusability, and scalability, making it easier to maintain and extend the verification process over time.
